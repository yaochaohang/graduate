# graduation project 
-This is my college graduation project
-The main use of HTML, CSS,javascript front-end technology
-The overall layout is done in HTML，Positioning and typesetting with CSS，I've done some of the page behavior in javascript
-This is a site I did when I was new to front-end technology, so it's a little bit simple, but it's memorable, so I gave it to Github for storage
